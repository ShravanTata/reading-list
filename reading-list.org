A good book. More like a collection of things, but the authors state this
upfront so it doesn't break the idea of a /flowing/ read. Has a light take on the
ideas it presents, which makes it a comfortable read without sounding overly
preachy.

This is a great book. Its of perfect length for the matter and the way it
presents them.

At places, it felt like doing a little bit of exaggeration by criticizing the
classical wisdom too much. Many of the times an approach which has less
explanation and theory behind it is frowned upon. Many of the group-behavior
based solutions fall in this category. They might work well, but their lack of
popularity is not /entirely/ surprising and irrational.

Also, the last chapter on democracy worries me a little. The point of the
chapter is that democracy is better than other forms because it uses the crowd's
wisdom, but it fails to make the a solid classification of the problem and
specify /why/ it solves them better. I guess this is more because there are
/problems/ rather than /a/ problem to be solved in a government and they are vary in
how they can be solved. Overall, the chapter, while presenting good arguments,
tries to convince you of something more vague. Not that the conclusion is wrong
(that group wisdom can be used much more effectively in a democracy), but the
examples leave places to fill in before you get completely satisfied.

I like how the book classifies the type of problems regularly faced by a crowd
and the conditions they need to make wise decisions there. These are some good
cues for analyzing and understanding cases presented in the book.

I don't think I got it completely. The story flows in a confusing and lazy way
and I stopped at many places while reading this. I thought a bit about whats
different here which is making the whole thing boring. Is it the weird way
people converse? Is it the repelling suspense in the story which I don't feel
like unraveling by pushing myself a few pages ahead?

Somewhere around 60-70% I got the genius (at least one) behind the writing
style. The annoyance you feel from the way the story progresses is meant to be
there and it helps you connect with K and his contempt for the court and the
whole bureaucracy. I still haven't tried to interpret every symbolism in the
story (and there are many, now that I think of it), but I do get the general
point now. More Kafka's and some connected philosophical readings should help to
get it right.

Here is a thing about self help books. You might not agree with them completely
and/or they might not present solid backing for all they say, but they do help
by letting you think about ideas you could not have thought much about
otherwise.

This particular book is a neat example. I bet it is /like/ (in spite of the
presentation, which brought me to read it) other similar books in the genre.
That means it fits into my earlier paragraph's argument and I wouldn't /strongly/
recommend this specific book but would recommend reading/thinking about the
topics it touches.
